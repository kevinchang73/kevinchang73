### Hi there, I am [Kai-Chun (Kevin) Chang](https://kevinchang73.github.io/)! ðŸ‘‹

I am a first-year PhD student in [EECS at University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Sanjit A. Seshia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/) and [Prof. Alberto L. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sangiovanni-vicentelli.html). 

Before coming to Berkley, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html). I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Iris Hui-Ru Jiang](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=24040) on graph neural network (GNN)-based timing macro modeling, and work with [Prof. Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/), [Prof. Qi Zhu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/zhu-qi.html) from Northwestern University, and [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/) from University of Liverpool on the design of a safety-guaranteed framework for neural network-based planners of connected and autonomous vehicles.

My main research interest lies in the **design, modeling, verification, and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPS)**, especially for (but not limited to) the application to **autonomous vehicles** and **transportation systems**. I am also interested in electronic design automation (EDA), with a focus on timing analysis and optimization, physical design optimization, and machine learning for EDA.

See my [homepage](https://kevinchang73.github.io/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-7NzGYwAAAAJ), [Medium](https://medium.com/@kevin.kaichunchang), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kai-chun-kevin-chang-22810a205) for more information.
